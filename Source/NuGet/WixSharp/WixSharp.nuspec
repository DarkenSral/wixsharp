    <description>Wix# is a framework for building a complete MSI or WiX source code by using build script files written with the C# syntax.
The package contains Wix# binaries, code sample and custom MSBuild target (to be merged with VS project and trigger building MSI during the project compilation).

If you need only Wix# binaries you may want to use WixSharp.bin package instead.

In order to use this package you need have WiX Toolset installed.
The package is tested against WIX (Windows Installer Xml) Toolset v3.10 (v3.10.2103.0)</description>

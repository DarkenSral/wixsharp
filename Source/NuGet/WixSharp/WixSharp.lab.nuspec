    <description>Wix# is a framework for building a complete MSI or WiX source code by using build script files written with the C# syntax.
The package contains the sample code for building a simple MSI with the CLR WinForm dialog inserted into UI sequence between InsallDirDlg and VerifyReadyDlg native MSI dialogs. In order to use this package you need have WiX Toolset installed.
